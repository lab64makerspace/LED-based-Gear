# OptoStim-mice

This device facilitates the optical stimulation of light-gated molecular interaction systems in mice and allows for the uniform illumination (450 nm) of mouse subjects as they move during exposure.

### Description of device

This is a 7x7 array of high power LEDs (SST-10-B-B130-N450) connected in parallel-series (sets of 7) in a grid with 15mm spacing between the LEDs with a simple on/off as supplied by an external power source. The device draws 21V and 2.45A, although the intensity of the LEDs may be tuned by varying the power.

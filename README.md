Equipment to study the optical control of protein function

This repo contains the material to produce and use the devices used in the [Cui Lab](https://cuilab.stanford.edu) at Stanford for studying the optical control of protein function. You can learn more about their work [here](https://cuilab.stanford.edu/optical-control-protein-function) but briefly-

### Optical Control of Protein Function

Cells constantly process environmental cues, such as growth factors, to make decisions on cell fate, e.g. survival, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. To ensure proper conversion of a specific environmental input into a distinct cellular output, the activation of intracellular signaling pathways is tightly regulated in space and time.

Compared with our understanding of the roles various proteins play in a multitude of cellular signaling pathways, much less is understood about how these temporal and spatial aspects affect cell behavior, largely due to the lack of effective tools to precisely regulate signaling pathways in space and time.

Our approach is to use light-gated protein-protein interaction systems to control the activation and inactivation of intracellular signaling pathways. This ability to optically control signaling pathways offers unprecedented precision in temporal and spatial dimensions.
